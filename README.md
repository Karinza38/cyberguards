### Problem with which we are tackling:
In the recent elections, as we saw there were many news which lack in authenticity and in the vast democracy like India, such type of problems can lead to catastrophobic results on the election outcome and they sometimes tend to sabotage the elections. Moreover, in our country there is a system of election propaganda, but we dont have any system to rate these propagandas on the basis of public opinion. If we have such a system to rate these promises/propagandas made by the candidates, then it will be much easier for the common public to make an informed decision while choosing the right candidate. The third problem that we see is that many times, people are not able to vote because they are doing there jobs or living in a remote location.


### Proposed Solution and Application Idea:
We aim to solve the above mentioned problems through the use of blockchain technology which will ensure that our system is robust, secure as well as reliable. We aim to achieve the below mentioned objectives through our application:
1. Enable a information verification system in which the news articles published by different news agencies will be published on a platform which will be hosted on a blockchain network, and then this information will be verified from reliable sources and rated accordingly.
2. Enable a voting system to rate the promises and propagandas of election candidates. These propagandas will be made public and then the user can upvote/downvote on the basis of his reviews of the propaganda. This will refrain the political parties to make any false promises in their agendas.
3. Enable a remote voting platform so that everyone who is not in their native place at the time of voting gets a fair chance to vote and participate in the electoral process.
